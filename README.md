Documentation of my experience in using CirleCI and Coveralls together

## CirleCI

Setup for CircleCI was very simple. I simply clicked through the registration process and was immediately able to look at the CircleCI dashboard it even automatically gave me access to private CI-registered repositories in organizations I'm part of. When I added tests CircleCI did not immediately recognize them.

I looked at https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/configuration/ to get a feel for configuring CircleCI.
